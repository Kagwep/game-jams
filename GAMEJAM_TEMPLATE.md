# GameJam Guide

A template for games to help new developers mod their games.
Please fill out this guide and add it to your project's repo!

(and drop the `_TEMPLATE`)

## Development

Provide development instructions for how to work on your game.
Include things like:

- How to install any necessary dependencies
- How to build and run your game

The goal is to help a new developer get your game up-and-running locally, and to be able to deploy their mod once they're done.

[See an example here.](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/dopewars/blob/main/README.md#development)

## Design and architecture

Help the new developer understand your game's design and architecture.
Include things like:

- Your game's basic concepts (entities, componenents, systems)
- Where to find key source files

The goal is to help a new developer quickly wrap their head what your game is and how it works.

## Modification ideas

Help the new developer think about where some good entry points would be to mod your game.
Include things like:

- Which mechanics would be simple to change but would have a big impact on gameplay (i.e. defining new cards in a card game)
- Possible interface improvements for client mods (i.e. additional stats, interesting possible views)

The goal is to help a new developer quickly start to develop ideas about *how* they might go about modding and extending your game / client.
