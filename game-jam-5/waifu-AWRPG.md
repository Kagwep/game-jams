# Waifu-AWRPG

### Project Summary
A free-to-use onchain protocol for creators to upload moddable waifu asset and invite friends to play. 

### GitHub
https://github.com/BriefCandle/dojo-gamejam

### Demo
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kbV8fInoxH__TWgDalZjnWg2hVzNu0Wh/view?usp=drive_link

### Play
- locally deploy
- press [h] to toggle burner wallet console
- use first burner to spawn a hero (who will be the enemy)
- switch to a second burner to spawn another hero
- click on enemy to target and shoot
- note: if doesn't work, refresh the page (because burner wallet is not updated in phaser)

### To Do (A lot)
- solve spine's premultiplied alpha issue
- design game loop, battle mechanism, etc. 
- allow content-providers to integrate tokenomics
- add ifps/arweave portal to upload/manage/load
- integrate with ai protocols for more immersive player ux
