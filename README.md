# Dojo Game Jams

![Vibe Jam Header](.github/assets/VibeHeader.png)

â€‹Dojo GÌ¶aÌ¶mÌ¶eÌ¶ Vibe Jam is here and starts on 6/20!!

â€‹Join us for a special vibe-coding edition of the Dojo Game Jam! Teams will come together for 3 days to build games on the open-source, provable Dojo Engine, and compete for a slice of a $25,000 prize pool.

## Tracks

This Game Jam will have two tracks: full games, and game mods.

1. The **Full Game Track** is for large or existing teams who want to ship full games or major features.
2. The **Modding Track** is for small teams and solo devs who want to get their feet wet by modding existing games.

## Prizes

We have a $25,000 prize pool to award to projects. $15,000 will go to projects in the **full game** track, and $10,000 will go to projects in the **modding** track.

> Please note: there will be **no airdrops** for participation in the Game Jam.
> Prizes will only be awarded to teams that build excellent projects that demonstrate the unique capabilities of the Dojo engine.
